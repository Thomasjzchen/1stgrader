Surprise!
The baby penguins came out of the eggs.
Another Surprise!
The same day, the mother penguins came back from the sea. 
They were fat from eating many fish. 
They came back to care for the baby penguins.
Mrs. Penguin saw all the dads and baby penguins. 
They were all making noise. 
But Mrs. Penguin knew Mr. Penguin's voice. 
She walked right to him.
Mr. Penguin said, "Meet our new little girl, Penny."
"Oh," said Mrs. Penguin.
"What a pretty little baby she is!"
Baby Penny was hungry.
Hungry penguin babies peck on their parents' bills.
Then the parents put food in the babies' mouths.
Mrs. Penguin fed Baby Penny.
"I'm very hungry too," said Mr. Penguin. 
"Now it's my turn to eat."
"We are too," said all the father penguins.
They waved their skinny flippers and said, "Good-bye." 
They all went into the water to find food.
for two weeks, Mr. Penguin and all the father penguins ate fish.
They ate fish night and day.
They ate fish heads, fish tails, fish fins, and fish gills.
They got round and fat.
Their Stomachs were full.
Then the fathers were ready to swim home.
They were ready to help care for the baby penguins.
A shark saw fat Mr. Penguin swimming home. 
The shark followed Mr. Penguin.
Mr. Penguin moved down, down into the deep water.
The shark went swimming after him.
Quick as a flash, Mr. Penguin zoomed up, up.
His flippers moved as fast as the wind.
He rolled onto his stomach. 
he slid through the water right up to the icy shore.
The hungry shark's mouth opened. 
He reached for Mr. Penguin's tail feathers.
The shark was unlucky. Mr. Penguin, quick as a flash, slid out the water.
He zoomed over the ice on his stomach.
He heard Mrs. Penguin's voice.
He heard Baby Penny's voice.
he slid right over to them.
